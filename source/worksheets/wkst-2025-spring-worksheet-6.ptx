            <p>
              Suppose <m>A = \{ 0,1,2,3,4\}</m>, <m>B = \{ 2,3,4,5 \}</m>, and <m>f = \{ (0,3), (1,3), (2,4), (3,2), (4,2) \}</m>. State the domain and range of <m>f</m>. Find <m>f(2)</m> and <m>f(1)</m>.

          <solution>
            <p>
              The domain of <m>f</m> is <m>A</m> and the range of <m>f</m> is the set <m>\{ 2,3,4 \}</m>. From the definition of <m>f</m>, we see that <m>f(1) = 3</m> since <m>(1,3) \in f</m>, and <m>f(2) = 4</m> since <m>(2,4) \in f</m>.

            <p>
              Show that the function <m>f: \R \setminus \{ 0 \} \to \R</m> defined by <m>f(x) = 1/x + 1</m> is injective but not surjective. How should the co-domain be modified to turn this function into a bijection?
            </p>
          </statement>

          <solution>
            <p>
              First we show that <m>f</m> is injective using the contrapositive, that is, proving that for any <m>a,b</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>, if <m>f(a) = f(b)</m> then <m>a = b</m>. Let <m>a,b \in \R \setminus \{ 0 \}</m> be arbitrary and assume <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>. Then we get that <m>1/a + 1 = 1/b + 1</m>. Subtracting <m>1</m> from both sides and cross multiplying yields that <m>a = b</m>. Hence <m>f</m> is injective.
            </p>

            <p>
              We prove that <m>f</m> is not surjective using the law of contradiction. So suppose <m>f</m> is surjective. Since <m>1</m> is in the co-domain of <m>f</m>, there exists <m>x_0 \in \R</m> so that <m>f(x_0) = 1</m>. Then <m>1/x_0 + 1 = 1</m>. Hence <m>1/x_0 = 0</m>, which does not hold for any real number <m>x_0</m>. By contradiction, we conclude that <m>f</m> is not surjective.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we modify the co-domain of <m>f</m> to be <m>\R \setminus \{ 0 \}</m> rather than <m>\R</m>, then the function will become a bijection.

            <p>
              Consider the function <m>h: \Z \times \Z \to \Q</m> defined by
              <me>h(m,n) = \frac{m}{|n| + 1} </me>.
              Determine whether this function is injective and whether the function is surjective.
            </p>
          </statement>

          <solution>
            <p>
              The function <m>h</m> is not injective. For any <m>m \neq 0</m> and <m>n \neq 0</m>,
              <me>h(m,n) = \frac{m}{|n|+1} = \frac{m}{|-n| + 1} = h(m,-n)</me>
              but <m>(m,n) \neq (m,-n)</m> since <m>n \neq -n</m>. Thus, in particular, <m>h(1,1) = h(1,-1)</m>, yet <m>(1,1) \neq (1,-1)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the function <m>h</m> is surjective. Let <m>b \in \Q</m> be an arbitrary element of the co-domain of <m>h</m>. Then we can write <m>b = p/q</m> for some <m>p,q \in \Z</m>, with <m>q > 0</m>. Then <m>(p,q-1) \in \Z \times \Z</m>, and is thus an element of the domain of <m>h</m>. And
              <me>h(p,q-1) = \frac{p}{|q-1| + 1} = \frac{p}{q-1+1} = \frac{p}{q} = b</me>.
              Thus <m>b</m> is in the range of <m>h</m>, completing the proof.

              This map is not well-defined. Let <m>x = .5</m>. Then we can write <m>x = 1/2</m> and <m>x = 2/4</m>. The former equation implies that <m>f(x) = 1/2</m>, whereas the latter implies <m>f(x) = 1/4</m>. The output of a function can only be a single value, which contradicts the fact that <m>1/2 \neq 1/4</m>.

      Prove that the sets <m>A = \{ n \in \Z: 0 \leq n \leq 5 \}</m> and <m>B = \{ n \in \Z : -5 \leq n \leq 0 \}</m> have the same cardinality.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      We can easily enumerate <m>A = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5 \}</m> and <m>B = \{ -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0 \}</m>, and thus we see immediately by counting that <m>|A| = 6</m> and <m>|B| = 6</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, we can explicitly find a bijection <m>f: A \to B</m>, whose existence is a statement equivalent to the statement that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same cardinality. We define <m>f(n) = -n</m> for <m>n \in A</m>. Then <m>f</m> is injective, which we prove directly. If <m>m,n \in A</m> and <m>m \neq n</m>, then <m>-m \neq -n</m>, which states precisely that <m>f(m) \neq f(n)</m>. Furthermore, <m>f</m> is surjective, which we also prove directly: if <m>n \in B</m>, then <m>-5 \leq n \leq 0</m>, which means that <m>0 \leq -n \leq 5</m>, and so <m>-n \in A</m>; we see that <m>f(-n) = -(-n) = n</m>, so that <m>n</m> is in the range of <m>f</m>. Since <m>f</m> is both injective and surjective, <m>f</m> is bijective and we conclude that <m>|A| = |B|</m>.

      Consider the function <m>f: (0,\infty) \to (0,1)</m> defined by
      <me>f(x) = \frac{x}{x+1}</me>.
      Show that this function is a bijection.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      Let <m>a,b \in (0,\infty)</m> and that <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>. Then
      <me>\frac{a}{a + 1} = \frac{b}{b+1}</me>.
      If we cross multiply, we conclude that <m>a(b+1) = b(a+1)</m>, or equivalently,
      <me>ab + a = ab + b</me>.
      Subtracting <m>ab</m> from both sides, we conclude that <m>a = b</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is injective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let <m>y \in (0,1)</m> be arbitrary. Let <m>x = y / (1 - y)</m>. Since <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m>, <m>0 \lt 1 - y \lt 1</m>, and so <m>x</m> is a well-defined positive number. We calculate that
      <me>f(x) = \frac{x}{x+1} = \frac{\frac{y}{1-y}}{\frac{y}{1 - y} + 1} = \frac{y}{y + (1 - y)} = y</me>.
      Thus <m>y</m> is in the range of <m>f</m>, and since <m>y</m> was arbitrary, <m>f</m> is surjective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>f</m> is both injective and surjective, <m>f</m> is bijective.

        Recall that the negation of a statement of the form <m>p \leftrightarrow q</m> can be written as <m>(p \wedge \neg q) \vee (\neg p \wedge q)</m>. Thus the statement can be written as <m>\exists x ( (F(x) \wedge \neg G(x)) \vee (\neg F(x) \wedge G(x)) )</m>. In English, this statement says <q>either there is a Math 240 TA who holds office hours before Midterm 1 and cannot answer my questions, or these is a Math 240 TA who does not hold office horus before Midterm 1 and can answer my questions</q>.

      Since the truth values of <m>(p \wedge q) \rightarrow r</m> and <m>(p \wedge \neg r) \rightarrow \neg q</m> are the same in each row of the truth table, it follows the two sentences are logically equivalent.

  <mrow>

</mrow>

<mrow>
\amp \equiv \neg (p \wedge q) \vee r

<mrow>
\amp \equiv p \wedge q \rightarrow r

Thus we see the two sentences are equivalent to one another.

        Prove that the statement <m>(p \rightarrow q) \leftrightarrow (p \wedge \neg q \rightarrow \neg p)</m> is a tautology, using whichever methods suffice.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Let us first simplify the right hand side using the laws of propositional logic:
        <md>
          <mrow>
          p \wedge \neg q \rightarrow \neg p \amp \equiv \neg (p \wedge \neg q) \vee \neg p

        <mrow>
        \amp \equiv \neg p \vee \neg \neg q \vee \neg p
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
      \amp \equiv \neg p \vee q
    </mrow>
  </md>
  But now we see the latter statement is equivalent to <m>p \rightarrow q</m>. Since a statement <m>r \leftrightarrow s</m> is a tautology if and only if <m>r \equiv s</m>, it follows that the statement <m>(p \rightarrow q) \leftrightarrow (p \wedge \neg q \rightarrow \neg p)</m> is a tautology.

      Since <m>a \divides b</m>, <m>b = ak</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus <m>|b| = |ak| = |a| |k|</m>. Note that by assumption <m>|b| \neq 0</m>, so both <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> are also non-zero. Since <m>k \in \Z</m>, <m>|k| \geq 1</m>, hence <m>|b| = |a| |k| \geq |a|</m>.

        Here is another solution. Since <m>a \divides b</m> and <m>b \divides a</m>, there exists positive integers <m>j</m> and <m>k</m> so that <m>b = aj</m> and <m>a = bk</m>.

        Find the mistake in the following proof:
      </p>

      <theorem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>a,b \in \Z</m> with <m>a \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m> and <m>b \equiv 2 \pmod{3}</m>. Then <m>a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{3}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>a \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m>, we have that <m>3 \divides a - 1</m>. Thus there exists <m>k \in \Z</m> such that <m>a - 1 = 3k</m>. Also, since <m>b \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m>, we also have <m>3 \divides b - 2</m>, so we can write <m>b - 2 = 3k</m>. Thus
            <me>a + b = (3k + 1) + (3k + 2) = 6k + 3 = 3(2k + 1)</me>. Therefore <m>a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{3}</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        The mistake in the proof is that we performed existential instantiation twice, first to write <m>a - 1</m> as <m>3k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, and the second to write <m>b - 2 = 3k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, but we did not use a separate variable for each use of existential instantiation (note we can also conclude that <m>a -1 = b-2</m> from this incorrect use of instantiation, which is not always true for all choices of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> satisfying the assumptions of the theorem). A correct use of the instantiation would be to write <m>b - 2 = 3j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>. Then we calculate that
        <me>a + b = (3k + 1) + (3j + 2) = 3k + 3j + 3 = 3(k + j + 1) </me>.
        Thus we can still correctly conclude that <m>a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{3}</m>.

        To show <m>(8,23) \in B</m> we must show that <m>8 \equiv 23 \pmod{5}</m>. But this holds because

Since <m>2</m> and <m>9</m> are coprime, this implies that <m>2 \cdot 9 = 18 \divides x_0</m>, so we can write <m>x_0 = 18k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
