            If <m>m</m> is even and <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>m + n</m> is odd.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>m</m> be even and let <m>n</m> be odd. Since <m>m</m> is even, <m>m = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Similarly, since <m>n</m> is odd, <m>n = 2j + 1</m> for some integer <m>j</m>. Then

            Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be integers.

          <p>
            Let <m>x</m> be a real number with <m>0 \lt x \lt 4</m>. Note that <m>0 \leq (x-2)^2</m>, or equivalently, <m>0 \geq - (x-2)^2</m>. Expanding and simplifying this inequality, we see that

            By assumption, <m>x > 0</m>, so dividing both sides of the inequality by <m>x</m> does not change the direction of the inequality; we conclude that

            Moreover, the assumption <m>x \lt 4</m> is equivalent to the assertion that <m>4 - x \gt 0</m>, which means dividing both sides of TODO by <m>4 - x</m> will not change the direction of the inequality. We thus conclude that

            Let <m>a</m> be any integer such that <m>a^2 \divides a</m>, so <m>a = a^2 k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Subtracting <m>a</m> from both sides of this equation and factoring the common factor <m>a</m>, we see that <m>a (ak - 1) = 0</m>. This means that either <m>a=0</m> or <m>ak=1</m>. If <m>a=0</m>, then we are done. Thus, if <m>a \neq 0</m>, we must have that <m>ak=1</m>. This means that <m>a</m> divides <m>1</m>. Hence, <m>a = \pm 1</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            We prove by contradiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose for the sake of contradiction that <m>\sqrt{3}</m> is rational. Then there exists integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, with no common factors, for which <m>\sqrt{3} = a/b</m>. Squaring both sides, we see that <m>3 = a^2/b^2</m>, which means that <m>a^2 = 3b^2</m>. Hence, <m>3 \mid a^2</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We claim that if <m>a \in \Z </m> and <m>3 \mid a^2</m>, then <m>3 \mid a</m>. We prove this claim via a proof by contraposition. Suppose <m>3 \not \divides a</m>. Then either <m>a \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m> or <m>a \equiv 2 \pmod{3}</m>, and we proceed by considering the two cases separately:

            <dl>
              <li>
                <title>Case 1:</title>

                <p>
                  Suppose that <m>a \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m>. Then <m>a = 3k + 1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus
                  <me>a^2 = (3k+1)^2 = 9k^2 + 6k+1 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1</me>,
                  so <m>a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m>, and thus <m>3 \not \divides a^2</m>.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <title>Case 2:</title>

                <p>
                  Suppose that <m>a \equiv 2 \pmod{3}</m>. Then <m>a = 3k+2</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus
                  <me>a^2 = (3k+2)^2 = 9k^2 + 6k + 4 = 3(3k^2 + 2k + 1) + 1</me>.
                  Thus <m>a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m>, and thus <m>3 \not \divides a^2</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </dl>

            The two cases complete the proof of the claim.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the claim we have just proved, since <m>3 \divides a^2</m>, then <m>3 \divides a</m>. By definition of divisibility, <m>a = 3j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>. This implies that <m>3b^2 = a^2 = (3j)^2 = 9j^2</m>. Therefore <m>b^2 = 3j^2</m>. This means that <m>3 \divides b^2</m>. But by what we have proven above, this means <m>3 \divides b</m> as well. Hence <m>3 \divides a</m> and <m>3 \divides b</m>, which contradicts the fact that the two integers have no common factors. This contradiction completes the proof.

Suppose <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> do not have the same parity. Without loss of generality, we may assume that <m>a</m> is even and <m>b</m> is odd. Then there exists inegeres <m>k</m> and <m>j</m> so that <m>a = 2k</m> and <m>b = 2j + 1</m>. Substituting these in, we see that <m>a + b = 2k + 2k + 1 = 4k + 1 = 2(2k) + 1</m>, so <m>a + b</m> is odd.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, to prove the <sq>if</sq> direction (that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> having the same parity implies that <m>a + b</m> is even). So assume <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same parity. Then either <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both even, or <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both odd. We prove the claim by splitting our proof into cases:

                  Case 1:

                <p>
                  Suppose that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both even. Then <m>a = 2k</m> and <m>b = 2j</m> for some integers <m>k</m> and <m>j</m>. Thus <m>a + b = 2k + 2j = 2(k+j)</m>, implying that <m>a + b</m>is even.

            Every real solution of the equation <m>x^3 + x + 3 = 0</m> is irrational.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We prove by contradiction. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a rational solution to the equation <m>x^3 + x + 3 = 0</m>, and let <m>a/b</m> be this rational solution, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers and <m>b \neq 0</m>. We may assume without loss of generality that this fraction is fully reduced, so <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are not both even. Then, we can substitute this into the polynomial equation to get that <m>(a/b)^3 + (a/b) + 3 = 0</m>. We can multiply through by <m>b^3</m> and simplify to obtain <m>a^3 + ab^2 + 3b^3 = 0</m>.

          <p>
            We now proceed by taking cases of the parity of $a$ and $b$:

                <title>Case 1:</title>

                <p>
                  Suppose both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are odd. Then we will see that all three numbers <m>a^3</m>, <m>ab^2</m>, and <m>3b^3</m> are odd, because they are the products of odd numbers. We will verify this in the following paragraph. But this means that we can write <m>a^3 = 2i + 1</m>, <m>ab^2 = 2j + 1</m>, and <m>3b^3 = 2k + 1</m> for some integers <m>i</m>, <m>j</m>, and <m>k</m>. And this implies that

                <p>
                  Using some basic number theory, as the product of odd numbers, we immediately see that <m>a^3</m>, <m>ab^2</m>, and <m>3b^3</m> are odd. But let us also prove the result from basic principles. We start by writing <m>a = 2i + 1</m> and <m>b = 2j + 1</m> for some integers <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>. Then

                  Suppose that one of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is odd and the other is even. Without loss of generality, suppose <m>a</m> is even and <m>b</m> is odd. Then <m>a = 2k</m> and <m>b=2j+1</m> for some integers <m>k</m> and <m>j</m>. We see that <m>a^3 = 8k^3 = 2(4k^3)</m>, so <m>a^3</m> is even. Moreover, <m>ab = (2k)(2j+1) = 2(2kj+k)</m>, meaning that <m>ab</m> is even. Finally,

Note that <m>a^3 + ab^2 + 3b^3 = (a^3 + 3b^3) + ab^2</m>. By TODO, <m>a^3+3b^3</m> is odd because it is the sum of two numbers with opposite parity. Similarly, <m>(a^3 + 3b^3) + ab^2</m> is odd because it is also the sum of two numbers with opposite parity. We once again have deduced that <m>0</m> is odd, which is a contradiction.

    <title>Worksheet Four Challenge Problems</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        The questions in this worksheet were given out in the forth week of the course, the week of February 10th-14th, 2025. All problems in this worksheet give a statement. Your goal is to find a proof of that statement, using any of the proof methods we have learned.
      </p>
    </introduction>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be positive numbers. If <m>x \leq y</m>, then <m>\sqrt{x} \leq \sqrt{y}</m>. You may <em>not</em> use the fact that the function <m>f(t) = t^{1/2}</m> is an increasing function to prove this statement. You <em>can</em> use the fact that for any positive number <m>t</m>, <m>t = (\sqrt{t})^2</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be positive numbers. Since <m>x \leq y</m>, we may subtract <m>y</m> from both sides of the inequality to conclude that <m>x - y \leq 0</m>. Since, for any positive number <m>t</m>, we have <m>t = (\sqrt{t})^2</m>, we conclude that <m>(\sqrt{x})^2 - (\sqrt{y})^2 \leq 0</m>. Factoring the left hand side of this inequality, we conclude that
            <me> (\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y})(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}) \leq 0 </me>.
            Since <m>\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} > 0</m>, we can divide both sides of the inequality bby <m>\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}</m> to conclude that <m>\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y} \leq 0</m>. But now adding <m>\sqrt{y}</m> to both sides of the inequality yields that <m>\sqrt{x} \leq \sqrt{y}</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are positive real numbers, then <m>2 \sqrt{xy} \leq x + y</m>.

            Use the previous problem.

        </hint>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be positive numbers. Note that for any real number <m>t</m>, <m>t^2 \geq 0</m>. In particular, <m>(x - y)^2 \geq 0</m>. Expanding this, and adding <m>4xy</m> to both sides of the equation, we conclude that <m>x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \geq 4xy</m>. The left hand side is equal to <m>(x + y)^2</m>. Thus we find that <m>4xy \leq (x + y)^2</m>. But now, invoking the result of the last problem, we conclude that <m>\sqrt{4xy} \leq \sqrt{(x + y)^2}</m>. But simplifying both sides of this inequality yields that <m>2 \sqrt{xy} \leq x + y</m>.

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>n</m> is a positive integer, then <m>2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We give a direct proof. Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary positive integer. Let
            <me> S \coloneqq 2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^n</me>.
            Observe that
            <me> 2S = 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n+1}</me>.
            All terms in the expansion of <m>2S</m> occur in <m>S</m>, except that <m>2^0</m> does not occur in <m>2S</m>, and <m>2^{n+1}</m> does not occur in <m>S</m>. Thus
            <me> 2S - S = 2^{n+1} - 2^0 = 2^{n+1} - 1 </me>.
            But <m>2S - S = S</m>, and so we conclude that <m>S = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.

            There is a prime number between <m>90</m> and <m>100</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We need to find a prime number between <m>90</m> and <m>100</m>. To find such a number, we work by process of elimination. The only numbers not divisible by <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> are <m>91</m>, <m>95</m>, <m>97</m>. However, <m>95</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>, and <m>91</m> is divisible by <m>7</m>, so if there is a prime number between <m>90</m> and <m>100</m>, it must be <m>97</m>. But now we can check that <m>97</m> is prime by checking it is not divisible by anything but <m>1</m> and itself. One shortcut that helps us here is using the next exercise, which means we need only check that no number between <m>2</m> and <m>10</m> divides <m>97</m>.

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>p \gt 1</m> and <m>n \nmod p</m> for each integer <m>n</m> for which <m>2 \leq n \leq \sqrt{p}</m>, then <m>p</m> is prime.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We prove this result by contraposition. Thus we assume that <m>p > 1</m>, and that <m>p</m> is not prime, and our goal is to show that there is an integer <m>n</m> with <m>n \divides p</m> and <m>2 \leq n \leq \sqrt{p}</m>. Since <m>p</m> is not prime, there exists <m>2 \leq m,n \lt p</m> with <m>p = mn</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose that <m>m \gt \sqrt{p}</m> and <m>n \gt \sqrt{p}</m>. Then <m>mn \gt \sqrt{p} \sqrt{p} = p</m>, which gives a contradiction. Thus, by a proof by contradiction, we conclude that either <m>m \leq \sqrt{p}</m> or <m>n \leq \sqrt{p}</m>. In either case, we find an integer between <m>2</m> and <m>\sqrt{p}</m> that divides <m>p</m>, which completes the proof.

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>x \in \Z</m> and <m>2 \divides x</m> and <m>4 \nmod x</m>, then <m>4 \divides x + 2</m> and <m>4 \divides x - 2</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We prove this result directly. Suppose <m>2 \divides x</m> and <m>4 \nmod x</m>. Since <m>2 \divides x</m>, we can write <m>x = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. By the division algorithm, there are unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>x = 4q + r</m> and <m>1 \leq r \leq 3</m>. Using TODO (Exercise 24 of Worksheet 4), since <m>x</m> is even, we must have <m>r = 2</m>, or else <m>x</m> would be an odd, giving a contradiction. Thus
            <me>x + 2 = 4q + 2 + 2 = 4(q+1)</me>,
            which implies <m>4 \divides x + 2</m>, and
            <me>x - 2 = 4q + 2 - 2 = 4q</me>,
            and so <m>4 \divides x-2</m>.

          <p>
            Assume <m>n</m> is an integer. Our goal is to show that <m>n(n+1)(n+2)</m> is divisible by <m>3</m>. To do this, we perform a proof by cases. We use the division algorithm to write <m>n = 3q + r</m> with <m>r = 0</m>, <m>r = 1</m>, or <m>r = 2</m>. We divide our proof into the different cases based on the value of <m>r</m>.

            <dl>
              <li>
                <title>Case 1 (<m>r = 0</m>):</title>

                Then <m>n = 3q</m>,
                <me>n(n+1)(n+2) = 3 ( q(n+1)(n+2) )</me>,
                and so <m>3 \divides n(n+1)(n+2)</m>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <title>Case 2 (<m>r = 1</m>):</title>

                Then <m>n+2 = 3q + 1 + 2 = 3(q+1)</m>,
                <me>n(n+1)(n+2) = 3 (n(n+1)(q+1))</me>,
                and so <m>3 \divides n(n+1)(n+2)</m>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <title>Case 3 (<m>r = 2</m>):</title>

                Then <m>n+1 = 3q + 2 + 1 = 3(q+1)</m>,
                <me>n(n+1)(n+2) = 3(n(q+1)(n+2))</me>,
                and so <m>3 \divides n(n+1)(n+2)</m>.
              </li>
            </dl>

            In each case, we have proven that <m>3 \divides n(n+1)(n+2)</m>, and so the claim is true in general.

        <statement>
          <p>
            The product of any five consecutive integers is divisible by <m>120</m>. As an example, the product of <m>3,4,5,6</m>, and <m>7</m> is <m>2520</m>, and <m>2520 = 120 \cdot 121</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We prove the result directly. Suppose <m>n</m> is an integer. Our goal is to show that <m>m = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)</m> is divisible by <m>120</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We note that the proof of the last argument generalizes to show that the product of any <m>k</m> consecutive integers is divisible by <m>k</m>, for any integer <m>k</m>. In particular, <m>m</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>.
          </p>

<!--          <p>
            By the division algorithm, there are unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>n = 5q + r</m> and <m>0 \lt r \leq 5</m>. Find an integer <m>i</m> with <m>r + i = 5</m> and <m>0 \leq i \lt 5</m>. Then <m>n + i = 5q + r+i = 5(q+1)</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>. Since <m>n+i</m> occurs in the definition of <m>m</m>, <m>m</m> is also divisible by <m>5</m>.
          </p>-->

          <p>
            By the previous exercise, <m>n(n+1)(n+2)</m> is divisible by <m>3</m>, and so <m>m</m> is divisible by <m>3</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also claim that the product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by <m>8</m>, i.e. for any <m>n</m>, <m>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)</m> is divisible by 8. To prove this, write <m>n = 4q + r</m>, where <m>0 \leq r \lt 4</m>. We prove the result by cases, depending on the value of <m>r</m>.

            <dl>
              <li>
                <title>Case 1 (<m>r = 0</m>):</title>

                In this case <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>4</m> and <m>n+2</m> is divisible by <m>2</m>, and so <m>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)</m> is divisible by <m>8</m>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <title>Case 2 (<m>r = 1</m>):</title>

                In this case <m>n+3</m> is divisible by <m>4</m> and <m>n+1</m> is divisible by <m>2</m>, and so <m>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)</m> is divisible by <m>8</m>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <title>Case 3 (<m>r = 2</m>):</title>

                In this case <m>n + 2</m> is divisible by <m>4</m> and <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>2</m>, and so <m>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)</m> is divisible by <m>8</m>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <title>Case 4 (<m>r = 3</m>):</title>

                In this case <m>n + 1</m> is divisible by <m>4</m> and <m>n + 3</m> is divisible by <m>2</m>, and so <m>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)</m> is divisible by <m>8</m>.
              </li>
            </dl>
            Since <m>n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)</m> is divisible by <m>8</m>, so is <m>m</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since <m>m</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>, <m>3</m>, and <m>8</m>, and these three numbers are <em>coprime</em>, it follows that <m>m</m> is divisible by <m>5 \cdot 3 \cdot 8 = 120</m> (this follows from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic). But this completes the proof.
