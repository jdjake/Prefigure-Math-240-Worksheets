          <solution>
            <p>
              The equation <m>n \mymod d = 0</m> means that <m>n = kd + 0</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, which is precisely the same statement as saying that <m>n \divides d</m>.

          <solution>
            <p>
              The information above tells us that <m>n = 2 \cdot 4 + 3 = 11</m>.

          <solution>
            <p>
              The divisors of 12 can be listed as <m>1,2,3,4,6,12</m> and the divisors of 28 can be listed as <m>1,2,4,7,14,28</m>. Comparing the two lists, we see that the greatest common divisor is 4, so <m>\text{gcd}(12,28) = 4</m>. Similarily, we can write the multiples of 12 as <m>12,24,36,48,60,72,84,96,\dots</m>, and the multiples of 28 as <m>28,56,84,\dots</m>, and we see that 84 is the smallest number common to both lists, so that <m>\text{lcm}(12,28) = 84</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, we can use prime factorizations to find the two values. Write
              <me>12 = 2^2 \cdot 3</me>
              and
              <me>28 = 2^2 \cdot 7</me>.
              The greatest common divisor is obtained by finding the intersection of the prime factors, and the least common multiple is obtained by finding the union of the prime factors, i.e. so that <m>\text{gcd}(12,28) = 2^2</m> and <m>\text{lcm}(12,28) = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = 84</m>.

            This statement is false. Although it is true that 7 is a prime, it is false that there are 120 days in a year, and both propositions need to be true in order for the proposition <q>7 is a prime number and there are 120 days in a year</q> to be true.

            We cannot determine the value of <m>p \wedge q</m>. If <m>q</m> were true, then <m>p \wedge q</m> would be true. But if <m>q</m> was false, then <m>p \wedge q</m> would be false.
