  The first two equivalences here use the conditional identtiies, the third uses the associative and commutative laws, the forth uses the complement law, and the last uses the domination law.

<exercise workspace="0.3in">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Write <q>Every cat is a bird</q> as a predicate logic statement. Be sure to define all predicates and state your domain.

  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      Let <m>C(x)</m> be the predicate <q><m>x</m> is a cat</q> and let <m>B(x)</m> be the predicate <q><m>x</m> is a bird</q>. Then the sentence <q>Every cat is a bird</q> can be written in predicate logic as the statement <m>\forall x (C(x) \rightarrow B(x))</m>. There are many choices of domain that correctly formalize the statement, as long as that domain contains the set of all cats: one choice is the set of all animals.

      Explain why <m>\forall x \exists x P(x,x)</m> is not a valid statement in predicate logic.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      The statement is not valid because the variable <m>x</m> is bound in two different ways, and so the use of <m>x</m> is ambiguous.

      Explain why <m>\neg \exists 3 P(3,x)</m> is not a valid statement.

  <solution>
    <p>
      The symbol <m>3</m> is a constant, and one can only apply quantifiers in predicate logic to variables.

            Give an example of a domain under which the statement <m>\exists x (x^3 = 2)</m> is true, and another example of a domain under which the statement is false.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            There are many choices of a domain under which the sentence is false. As an example, if our domain is the set of all integers, then this statement is false, since there exists no integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n^3 = 2</m>. This can be seen more precisely by noting that no integer <m>n \in \{ -1, 0, 1 \}</m> satisfies the equation, and any other integer <m>n</m> has <m>|n^3| > 2</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the statement is interpreted over the domain of all real numbers, then the sentence will be true; the number <m>x = \sqrt[3]{2}</m> has this property.

            We write
